## Libxslt Extension Modules

This collection implements various extension elements and functions for libxslt
that have proved useful in a few projects. The functions or elements actually
implemented follow no particular plan, rather they are somewhat randomly chosen
based on immediate need over time.

They attempt to follow the specifications from [exslt.org](http://exslt.org/)
or XPath 2.0 functions where feasible, although some functions appear in
neither specification. Since XPath 2.0 has a number of features not present in
the libxml2 implementation, corresponding implementations are at most similar
rather than identical.
